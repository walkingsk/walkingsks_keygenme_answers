# legacyys_keygenme_quick

This one is an easy start

- key in `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` format
- strlen must be 14
- dashes (`'-'`) must appear in the right places
- as in `AAAA-BBBB-CCCC`:
  - AAAA must be digits (`'0' - '9'`)
  - BBBB must be even for each B
  - CCCC must be exactly `"R3KT"`

note:
- in the crackme the author checks even for each byte within a group.
- even when a byte has already been tested odd, the 4-byte-loop continues, this can be optimized
